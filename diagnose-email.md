# Email Delivery Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: User not receiving confirmation emails after signup

### Current Status:
- ✅ Signup flow working (user gets confirmation screen)
- ✅ Enhanced debugging added to signup page
- ✅ Resend email functionality implemented
- ❌ Emails not being delivered

### Most Likely Causes:

## 1. **Supabase Email Settings** (MOST LIKELY)
Check in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings:
- **Email confirmation required**: Should be ENABLED
- **Email rate limiting**: May be blocking repeated requests
- **Custom SMTP**: Not configured (using default Supabase email)

### Action: Log into Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to Authentication → Settings
3. Check "Email" section settings
4. Verify "Confirm email" is enabled

## 2. **Email Provider Blocking**
Supabase default email domain: `noreply@ljyeewnjtkcvbrjjpzyw.supabase.co`
- Some email providers block unknown domains
- Gmail/Yahoo may filter to spam more aggressively
- Corporate email may have stricter filters

### Action: Test with different email providers
- Try Gmail, Yahoo, and a corporate email
- Check spam/junk folders thoroughly
- Wait 10+ minutes for delivery

## 3. **Rate Limiting**
Supabase has rate limits on email sending:
- May be hitting signup limits
- Previous test emails may have triggered limits

### Action: Wait and test with new email
- Use a completely fresh email address
- Wait 1+ hours between tests
- Try different email domains

## 4. **Configuration Issues**
- Environment variables loaded correctly ✅
- Supabase connection working ✅
- Authentication flow functional ✅

## 5. **Testing Steps**

### Step 1: Check Supabase Dashboard
1. Log into Supabase dashboard
2. Go to Authentication → Users
3. Check if test users are being created
4. Look at user email_confirmed_at field

### Step 2: Test Email Delivery
1. Open `/email-test.html` in browser
2. Try signup with fresh email address
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Monitor for email delivery

### Step 3: Check Email Logs (if available)
1. Supabase Dashboard → Logs
2. Look for email-related errors
3. Check for rate limiting messages

## 6. **Immediate Actions**
1. **Check Supabase email settings** (highest priority)
2. **Test with multiple email providers**
3. **Wait for email delivery** (up to 15 minutes)
4. **Contact Supabase support** if settings look correct

## 7. **Alternative Solutions**
If Supabase email continues to fail:
1. **Configure custom SMTP** (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.)
2. **Disable email confirmation** temporarily for testing
3. **Manual user approval** process
